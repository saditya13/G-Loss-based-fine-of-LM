## Introduction

Fine-tuning pre-trained language models like *SBERT* often relies on instance- or pair-wise loss functions, which fail to capture global semantic relationships and incur high computational costs.

We propose **G-Loss**, a graph-driven loss function computed using label propagation, capturing holistic semantic relationships leading to better embedding alignment.Â 

We evaluate **G-Loss** on five datasets: MR for sentiment classification, R8 and R52 for topic classification, *Ohsumed* for medical document classification, and 20NG for news categorization.

**G-Loss** enabled *SBERT* to outclass or closely match the performance of *TextGCN*, *BertGCN-BERT*, and *BertGCN-RoBERTa*.

To compute *G-Loss*:
* Embedding Extraction: Embed the input data using the specified language model.
* Similarity Graph Construction: Construct a graph based on the similarity of embeddings within a mini-batch.
* Label Masking: Mask a subset of node labels for _Label Propagation_.
* Iterative Label Propagation (LPA): Perform iterative label propagation to infer labels for the masked nodes.
* Loss Computation: Calculate the cross-entropy loss between the LPA-predicted labels and the ground truth labels of the masked nodes.

The computed loss is propagated to the language model, which then updates itself.
A key feature of this approach is that the graph evolves dynamically over fine-tuning epochs, improving semantic representation as embeddings become more refined.

        conda create -n my_env python=3.10
        conda activate my_env
        ```

    *   **Using venv (Built-in to Python):**

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv my_env  # Or python -m venv my_env depending on your setup
        source my_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: my_env\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **Using virtualenv (If you prefer this):**

        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        virtualenv my_env
        source my_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: my_env\Scripts\activate
        ```
