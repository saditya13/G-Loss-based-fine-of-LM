said the treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in of billion stg after a billion shortfall in inflation is expected to be pct at the end of this year lawson said as i forecast in the autumn statement inflation may continue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding pct by the summer before falling back to pct by the end of the year he added turning to the public sector borrowing requirement psbr lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal was billion stg or pct of gdp the planned psbr for was set at billion stg on monetary policy lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow m measure would be two to six pct in fiscal no explicit target was set for the broad sterling m aggregate he said but broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as of course will the exchange rate the chancellor told parliament lawson said the low outturn of the psbr in is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non oil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular on oil prices lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that north sea crude prices will average dlrs per barrel in calendar he said it is clear that the increased flow of non oil tax revenues coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts the public finances in a very strong position lawson said the treasury would strive to keep the psbr at pct of gdp in future we have reached what i judge to be the medium term financial strategy s appropriate destination a psbr of pct of gdp my aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead lawson said inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope i have this year for reducing the burden of taxation which of course remains a major objective of government policy but i am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution and to build a still firmer base for the future lawson said the time had come to strike the exchange control act from the statute book on corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchanged at pct in but companies capital gains will be charged at the appropriate corporation tax rate he said that under the new proposed system companies should be able to set advanced capital tax act payments against tax on capital gains taken together these changes should yield mln stg in lawson said lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due i also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax to be known as pay and file this would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection and would not come into force until the early s lawson said he planned two reliefs on petroleum revenue tax prt as from today companies may elect to have up to pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their prt liabilities in existing fields until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred second there will be a new relief against prt for spending on research into u k oil extraction that is not related to any particular field on business employment lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers lawson said that in future traders registered for value added tax vat would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received small businesses may account for vat annually instead of quarterly the vat compulsory registration period was being extended to days he added and vat registration thresholds are to be raised to stg new measures are planned to combat vat avoidance he added the capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at stg lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment the change will take effect on april but genuine trading companies will not be affected he also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans also from april in future banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said the standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence to pct from pct lawson reiterated the government s aim of reducing basic taxation to pence in the pound but added given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope i now have to reduce the psbr that goal cannot be achieved in this budget small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to pct he said on the lloyd s insurance market lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of lloyd s syndicates bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders the inland revenue would be told to consult urgently with lloyd s

3195,sugar prices too low to boost latin output latin american sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said although prices have risen to around eight from five u s cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the region s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost the recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert manuel rico a consultant with the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting countries geplacea told reuters however rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said officials in mexico guatemala and ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go the prices are ridiculous said julian mateo vice president of costa rica s sugar cane industrial agricultural league at current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets an official at colombia s national association of sugar cane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets the market is very unstable what is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything in the latest year for which full figures are available central and south american nations produced mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which mln were exported a year earlier they had produced and exported about more according to the london based international sugar organization years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover miguel guerrero director of the dominican republic s national sugar institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply output had slumped to under tonnes a year from in the late s obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added plans of nearby cuba the world s largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said output is running well below the record mln produced in cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countries under special deals last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to mln tonnes from mln in the low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover u s and in the case of some caribbean countries european community ec import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels progressive reductions in the u s quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market peru for example shipped tonnes to the u s in both and this fell to in and this year its quota is only a national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of peru s production cost the future of the industry is uncertain at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the group s executive secretary eduardo latorre grows like a weed throughout the region brazil the largest cane producer with output of around mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency the difference in the price the state run sugar and alcohol institute iaa pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some mln dlrs a year soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meant brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in trade sources said negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles however the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps sources within latin america and the caribbean hold little hope for the region s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the u s and ec change their policies the agricultural policies of the european community and of the united states have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries brazil s trade and industry minister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplacea meeting the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets geplacea officials say this is the main cause of low prices geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region s industry out of steady decline such an agreement would have to have both u s and ec backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact they have to realise

865,economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to

1608,u s urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan the u s is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u s debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the u s debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines reuter,interest

5711,u s fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter,money-fx

3470,economic spotlight u s deficit with nics the u s trade deficit with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the u s in will get bigger this time next year the u s will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the u s after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the u s drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods u s treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects a reduction in japan s trade surplus this year but u s manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it s nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia s four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr u s merchandise trade deficit for the u s trade gap with taiwan rose to

shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up pct from a year earlier the gap with korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the u s wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan s trade surplus with the u s will fall in the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to units in from zero in the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the u s manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the u s takes pct of korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment a recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the u s while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the u s these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to a lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s

2452,cocoa latest focus for commodity pact negotiators the credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when international coffee organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated this week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work the still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the international tin council itc which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations the itc s failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade a more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new international natural rubber agreement in geneva at the weekend some importing countries insist the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought one consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the icco for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder on friday this uncertainty helped push london cocoa futures down to eight month lows the strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices the icco daily and average prices on friday fell below the must buy level of sdrs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last icco session in january but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given the agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets a cash balance of some mln dlrs and a stock of almost tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement members finance the stock through a dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade it has an upper limit of tonnes the key arguments being faced by the icco working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa another working group is scheduled to meet wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on thursday producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non member countries such as malaysia consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium priced high quality cocoas the argument over buying non member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities european industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non member cocoa and that it use the london futures market s existing differentials for different qualities currently good west african cocoa is tendered at par onto the london market discounts which are currently under review range up to stg a tonne for brazilian and malaysian cocoa consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower the january talks were slowed by a split inside the european community a key icco consumer group with france siding with producers ec representatives met in closed session in brussels on friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the nations the source said the ec will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there one icco delegate describing the producer consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not in contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers in either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers reuter,cocoa

pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s

encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned
